# ZymoFieldDiv
Repository for the scripts from Zymoseptoria tritici show local differences in within-field diversity and effector variation (2024).
It has R scripts, py scripts and shell scripts.
The numbering of the script denote the pipeline order, and relate directly to the steo in the process along the three directories.
Almost all the plots were generated using R, so those don't have a number but are listed following the same logic.
