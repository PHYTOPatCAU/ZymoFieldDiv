# ZymoFieldDiv
Repository for the scripts from Zymoseptoria tritici shows local differences in within-field diversity and effector variation (2025).
It has R scripts, py scripts and shell scripts.
The script's numbering denotes the pipeline order and relates directly to each step in the process along the three directories.
Almost all the plots were generated using R, so those without a number are listed following the same logic.
